## [Unreleased]

### 2026-08-18 (Engineering gaps)

- **Pipeline split**: `run_pipeline_on_source` 515 lines CC=98 → 173 lines CC=30
  (per-stage functions + `_PipelineContext`); matcher `_match_call_impl`
  151 lines CC=48 → 35 lines CC=7 (per-rule-type methods)
- **Doc: back-references**: 3 → 14, covering all 10 MODEL_INDEX entries
- **Unused imports**: cleaned 6 real issues (kept re-export compatibility)
- **Docs hygiene**: one-time plan docs removed after completion (results
  recorded in CHANGELOG)

### 2026-08-18 (Open-source readiness)

- **Config complexity management**: config source tracking (`_sources` /
  `resolve_with_sources`), `tpc config dump` debug command, declaration
  structure validation, GrammarRule field schema (fail-fast)
- **Lexer config dependency injection**: token/number configs now follow the
  language pack (no more cross-language contamination in one process)
- **Pipeline moved to `pipeline/` package**: `run_pipeline_on_source` shared by
  CLI and tests; wheel install works from any directory
- **Packaging fixed**: grammar TOML shipped as package-data (preserves
  verilog/c4 directory structure); IEEE Annex A docs and PDFs excluded from
  sdist (copyright)
- **Docs**: code quality audit, config complexity plan, open-source readiness plan

### 2026-08-13 (P2 engineering wrap-up)

- Documented P2.0 items: config_lifecycle / expression_conventions /
  component_protocol / c4 minimal language-pack template
- Install verification: `pip install -e ".[test]"` + CLI smoke test
- Coverage gate: .coveragerc (omit entry/fallback, fail_under=84, measured 84.57%)
- Restored CI: .github/workflows/ci.yml (Windows + Python 3.11/3.12/3.13)
- Fixed: linter `to_dict` dead code → `lsp_diagnostic` (`--json` crash bug)
- Removed dead code core/component_loader.py (superseded by plugin_loader)

### 2026-08-13 (P1 complete)

- formatter: width wrap pass, SV base coverage (logic/always_ff/always_comb),
  style parameterization (formatter.style)
- Preprocessor primitive-level unit tests (19)
- Enhanced render verification (nested/invert + TypeNestedPort layout)
- Number-shape configuration: declaration → FSM generator + language-pack
  declarations + signed `'s` + `0'b1` standard rejection

### 2026-08-12 (P0 second language)

- c4 full implementation (.c → c4 VM assembly), 6 integration tests — proof of
  language-agnosticism
- P0.3 penetration cleanup: boundary language penetration removed (ScopeKind
  rule derivation)
- Fixed 7 core penetrations / single-language assumptions (see
  docs/language_walkthrough.md §7)

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release: Verilog language pack + full pipeline
  (lex/parse/analyze/transform/render/lint)
- formatter plugin (category alignment / indent / ifdef / idempotency)
- typed_ports enhanced syntax (typed ports / impl binding / auto-connect)
- Preprocessor (macro expansion / conditional compilation reverse)
